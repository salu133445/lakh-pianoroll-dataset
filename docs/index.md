The Lakh Pianoroll Dataset (LPD) is a collection of 174,154
[multi-track piano-rolls](data) derived from the
[Lakh MIDI Dataset](http://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) (LMD).

## Getting the dataset

We provide multiple subsets and versions of the dataset. See [here](comparisons)
for comparisons. The dataset is available [here](dataset).

## Using LPD

The multi-track piano-rolls in LPD are stored in a special format for
efficient I/O and to save space. We recommend to load the data with
[Pypianoroll](https://salu133445.github.io/pypianoroll/)\*. See
[here](https://salu133445.github.io/pypianoroll/save_load.html) to learn how
the data is stored and how to load the data properly.

\* *The dataset is created using Pypianoroll (v0.3.0).*
